Analyze UFO sighting data

## Project Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to create a dynamic webpage that allows users to sort a data table of UFO sightings on different criteria: date, city, state, country & shape.

## Results

* A new user would be able to visit the site and input different criteria into the Filter Search section at left
![Filter Search Bar](https://github.com/krockway/UFOs/blob/main/static/images/filters.jpg)
* As seen above, the search area shows a user the type of data expected in each cell (example: Enter Date 1/10/2010).
Once a user inputs their selection, the table at right will filter to their inputs. A user is able to input multiple filter criteria at once, to narrow down their results.

* The user must manually clear their inputs and return the data to it's full, "raw" state.

## Summary & Next Steps

* One drawback of the new design is that there is a lot of room for user error. For example, if I input 'US' instead of 'us', no results will appear. Ideally the user would be able to see all available values in a dropdown checkbox & select any that apply.
* To enhance the user experience, I would add a button that clears any previously input searches. Currently the user has to manually undo any values they've input, a button could clear the search results for all cells at once.
* Secondly I would add another filter for duration. I would be interested to know which experiences lasted a few seconds vs a few minutes. What is the longest experience? The shortest?
